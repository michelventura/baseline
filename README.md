# Baseline

* A custom starter theme for the Genesis Framework

## Basic starting customizations

(Mostly for my team at [BizBudding Inc.](https://bizbudding.com/))

1. Change the theme directory name to match the domain (example-site.com) would be /genesis/example-site/
1. Remove (or change) GitHub Theme URI and GitHub Branch from style.css to stop automatic updates for the starter theme
1. Change theme name at the top of style.css and functions.php
1. Change version number in style.css and functions.php (leave Baseline version number in style.css)
1. Change theme URL in functions.php, if needed
1. Search and replace full theme for 'prefix_' and replace with your prefix for new site
1. Update exact image dimensions for .site-title a {} is style.css
1. Use those dimensions for the login logo on the prefix_custom_dashboard_logo() function near the bottom of functions.php
1. Search and replace the default link/button color (#067CCC) with whatever the main 'accent' color is for a base color scheme
